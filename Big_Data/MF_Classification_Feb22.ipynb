    "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many changes in people's habits, including an increase in the number of young people who have started investing their excess savings or stimulus money received from governments. According to a survey conducted by brokerage firm Charles Schwab, 15% of respondents started investing in 2020. Some of these investors have gained attention in the news for their involvement in the GameStop short squeeze earlier in 2021. As the pandemic and its restrictions begin to ease, central banks are indicating the end of their accommodative policies due to the risk of persistent inflation. This may signal the end of \"easy money\" for retail investors and the need to create diversified portfolios to face uncertainties.\n",

    "In this coursework, we aim to explore how distributed computing can be used to enhance investment decisions. Mutual funds, which are investment vehicles managed by a fund manager to generate returns for shareholders, often involve fees. With a vast number of funds available (our file contains 23,783 funds!), it can be challenging for non-professional investors to build a portfolio, as there are numerous choices to compare with different performance metrics, and many funds that overlap in their stated categories or investment policies."

    "At a high level, mutual funds are typically categorized based on their investment type, which is usually abbreviated to three categories: value, growth, or blend. Value investing involves comparing assets to each other and their intrinsic values to identify undervalued assets. Growth investing focuses on assets with high growth potential, regardless of perceived value. Blend funds are a combination of both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a lower level, mutual funds can also be classified based on their asset class (such as bonds or equities), universe (such as corporate or sovereign), industry (such as technology), or region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that mutual funds are categorized based on their investment objectives rather than their performance or affordability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that active mutual fund managers are typically compensated based on their performance relative to a benchmark index and their ranking. However, this can lead to negative consequences, such as managers taking on more risk than stated in their policy to outperform the index and achieve higher rankings (as seen in the H2O Asset Management scandal). On the other hand, fund managers may be incentivized to simply follow the index and barely beat it, resulting in the fund outperforming its index but investors still losing money after accounting for fund expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates that a lack of understanding regarding the risk-return pattern can result in inefficient investment decisions and performance that falls short of expectations. Therefore, improved classification based on fund performance, costs, and structure is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly pertinent given that empirical evidence of historical returns of active mutual funds compared to their benchmarks has indicated that less than 10% are able to produce excess returns (alpha) over a ten-year time frame. This percentage is further reduced once taxes and fees are factored in."

    "The hypotheses of this coursework focus on the notion that fund classification is suboptimal, with many funds being misclassified for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited number of investment types**: We believe that simply categorizing funds as value or growth is not informative enough, especially when the majority of funds end up being classified as blend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overcategorization**: There are too many categories that may not always be relevant (such as Target Date Retirement and Children's Education funds, which are simply marketing names for hybrid funds invested in equities and bonds) or are repetitive (such as Muni California Long and Muni New York, which are both municipal bonds).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voluntary misclassifications to improve a fund's rating or trading volume**: For example, Investment Grade Bond Funds that invest in lower-rated (riskier) bonds than implied by their name."

For instance, the 10-year return includes the 3-year return, while the Treynor ratio comprises the portfolio return and beta.\n",

    "In this coursework, we have demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to large datasets for investment decision-making. Although our dataset was relatively small compared to Big Data standards, we believe that our approach can be scaled to larger datasets by applying the same constraints specific to distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary objective was to identify a cluster of the best-performing mutual funds based on a combination of performance metrics, rather than their traditional investment objectives or classifications. Our first run of the K-Means algorithm led us to identify two clusters that were more efficient than the others. However, we found that the mean-variance optimization approach, as taught in the Modern Portfolio Theory, was not enough to consider the excess return over the benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this limitation, we used more features in our K-Means algorithm to confirm that most active mutual funds underperform the market, as the average alpha generated was negative. Our clustering approach effectively narrowed down the vast selection of mutual funds to a diversified cluster that would be more manageable for retail investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of our approach is that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Our clustering approach provided interesting categories to explore further, such as Equity Precious Metals, Health, and China Region, which had the best risk-adjusted excess return in recent years. However, mean reversion is common in financial markets, and further analysis and insights from the future will be necessary to make definitive investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our approach demonstrated the potential of machine learning in investment decision-making, highlighting the importance of a data-driven approach to navigate the vast selection of mutual funds and make informed investment decisions."
